Lets say someone accidentally deleted all the whitespaces from a sentence. Write a program to reconstruct the sentence from that stripped out string. Assume you have access to a dictionary function that returns if a given string is a valid word or not. 

Example Input: thisisavalidsentence 
       Output: this is a valid sentence
